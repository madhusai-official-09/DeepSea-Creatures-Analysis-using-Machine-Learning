# 🌊 Deep Sea Creatures Analysis using Machine Learning 🐠

## Overview 📜

This project analyzes data related to deep-sea creatures, using machine learning techniques. The initial data exploration focuses on episode ratings (misleading, from old notebook) and other characteristics obtained from a CSV file. The goal is to explore the data and identify potential trends or patterns.

**🚨 IMPORTANT: The project currently contains a notebook (`KNN.ipynb`) and a CSV file (`MoneyHeist.csv`) with content related to Money Heist episode analysis. This `README` assumes that these files will be updated with code and data relevant to deep-sea creatures analysis. 🚨**

## Data 📊

The data (currently - but **should be changed**) is stored in the `MoneyHeist.csv` file. The CSV contains the following columns:

*   **Date:** 📅 Release date of the episode (should be Deep Sea Creature Date).
*   **Season:** 🔢 Season number (likely irrelevant).
*   **Episode:** 🔢 Episode number within the season (likely irrelevant).
*   **Title:** 💬 Episode title (original language - should be replaced).
*   **Title(English):** 💬 Episode title (English translation - should be replaced).
*   **Description:** 📝 Episode description/summary (should be replaced).
*   **Rate:** ⭐ Episode rating (likely from IMDb - irrelevant).
*   **RateNumber:** 🗳️ Number of ratings for the episode (irrelevant).

**⚠️ WARNING: This data description is based on the Money Heist data in the notebook. It MUST be updated to reflect the actual Deep Sea Creatures data. ⚠️**

**Expected Deep Sea Creatures Data Fields:**

*   **Species:** 🐙 Name of the deep-sea creature species.
*   **Location:** 📍 Geographic coordinates where the creature was observed.
*   **Depth:** 📏 Depth at which the creature was observed (in meters).
*   **Size:** 📏 Size of the creature.
*   **[Other relevant features]** ➕

## Project Structure 📂

*   `KNN.ipynb`: 📓 Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis. (**MUST BE UPDATED!**)
*   `MoneyHeist.csv`: 💾 The dataset used for initial exploration. (**MUST BE REPLACED!**)

## Dependencies ⚙️

The project uses the following Python libraries:

*   pandas
*   matplotlib
*   seaborn
*   scikit-learn (for machine learning - add other libraries)

You can install these using `pip` (remember to create a `requirements.txt` file):
